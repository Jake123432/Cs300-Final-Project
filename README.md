# Cs300-Final-Project

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

Throughout this course we learned about data structures and algorithm building in C++, specifically linked list, Hash tables, and Binary search trees. The main idea was to be able to discern, understand, and create these different algorithms, while understanding what data structure would be better to use in what scenario or project. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Data structures are extremely important to understand, for example hash tables are extremely good a quick searches of different data so you can easily locate very specific things within the database, while linked list have a quick sort feature making it easy to sort out the different data, and binary search trees are traversal, so they already have a built in sorting method. Knowing what data structure is better than others depending on the project or scenario is crucial to high level developing. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Well I would normally just go on youtube and find examples, or look in the resources for good examples of any issue I had, and if I still could not figure it out after a couple days, I would email my professor to get a real time answer or hint for my specific problem. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

The work on this project definetely expanded my understanding on hashtables, and how to properly implement this data strcuture to solve direct to the correct course information. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Well it helped me dive deep into hashtables, understanding that collosions will slow down repsonse time, and having creating code that is more effecient than what I did before. overall this project taught me alot obout data structures in general, even knowing which to use for each use case was extremely important. Within the project you could have done a BSC or even a linked list, but I wanted to prioritize searching simply because I feel like that would be the main use of the menu, to see prerequisites of courses and any specific information that was needed by the user about each course.
